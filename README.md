In our recent years, we have seen a sudden shift in the public perception and upcoming trends. One such example of a rising trend is the increase in the purchases of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles. This new product category has certainly drawn a lot of consumers and has created an increased demand for such automotive goods. Hence, our project is focused on studying the future of this growing category and forecast the necessary infrastructure such as EV Charging Stations.

# Dataset

The data set can be downloaded via github: ("https://github.com/dhimansarkar18/EV-Charging-Stations-Prediction-Analytics/blob/main/ML_dataset.csv") 

Upon downloading the dataset, a python notebook was created for further analysis.

# Code

Python Notebook: ("https://github.com/dhimansarkar18/EV-Charging-Stations-Prediction-Analytics/blob/main/EV_Charging_Station_Prediction_Code.ipynb")

# Instructions on how to launch

I. Open the python notebook on google colab. 

II. Mount the Google Drive: drive.mount("/content/drive") 

III. Link the working directories: census = "//content/drive/MyDrive/EV Charging Stations/ML_dataset.csv" 

IV. Run the Code 

V. Refer to the Project Report for better Understanding  (" https://github.com/dhimansarkar18/EV-Charging-Stations-Prediction-Analytics/blob/main/Electric%20Vehicles%20Charging%20Stations%20Predictive%20Analytics%20(Project%20Report).pdf")
